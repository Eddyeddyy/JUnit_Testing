# JUnit_Testing

In this project, I demonstrate the use of JUnit testing and testing my code to ensure that everything is working as intended. The use of self tests can help 
not only speed up the process of software development, but also help develolpers gain insight on their own code. Taking client requirements and creating tests 
revolving those requirements will ensure that the project will be deemed a success. With JUnit tests, we can ensure that our code is sound and stable. This is because
with self set=up tests we can make sure that evrything we want to work, works as intended.
